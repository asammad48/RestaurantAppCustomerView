You are a senior React + Three.js engineer.

TASK:
Implement FULL 3D GESTURE INTERACTION on a SINGLE 3D ITEM using React Three Fiber.
The 3D item MUST be completely INDEPENDENT from other objects and the camera.

==================================================
TECH STACK (MANDATORY)
==================================================
- React
- three
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei
- @use-gesture/react

==================================================
CORE REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
==================================================

1) OBJECT-LEVEL INTERACTION ONLY
- Gestures must apply ONLY to the selected 3D object
- Camera must NOT rotate, pan, or zoom
- Other 3D objects must remain unaffected

2) GESTURE MAPPING (MUST IMPLEMENT)
- Single finger drag / mouse drag → Rotate object
- Two-finger pinch → Scale object (expand / shrink)
- Two-finger drag → Move object on X/Y axis
- Mouse wheel → Scale object
- Double tap / double click → Reset object position, rotation, scale

3) DEPTH & REAL 3D FEEL
- Use PerspectiveCamera
- Proper lighting
- Shadows enabled
- True Z-depth perception

==================================================
IMPLEMENTATION RULES
==================================================
- Disable OrbitControls completely
- Attach gestures directly to the mesh (NOT Canvas)
- Use @use-gesture/react for gestures
- Use stopPropagation() on pointer events
- Use position, rotation, scale for transformations
- Must support mobile (touch) AND desktop (mouse)
- No global gesture listeners
- No external state management

==================================================
SCENE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================
- One interactive 3D object (gesture enabled)
- One non-interactive 3D object (to prove independence)
- Fixed camera
- Clean lighting setup

==================================================
FILE STRUCTURE
==================================================
- Single React file
- Fully working, runnable code
- No placeholders
- Clear inline comments explaining gestures

==================================================
DO NOT
==================================================
- Do NOT use OrbitControls
- Do NOT move or rotate the camera
- Do NOT attach gestures to Canvas
- Do NOT affect other objects
- Do NOT rename variables unless required
- Do NOT use deprecated APIs

==================================================
BONUS (OPTIONAL BUT PREFERRED)
==================================================
- Smooth damping / lerp
- Min / max scale limits
- Mobile performance optimizations

==================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
==================================================
Interaction should feel like:
Apple AR / Sketchfab style object interaction

Object moves, rotates, scales independently
inside a fixed 3D scene.

OUTPUT:
Return ONLY the complete React file code.
