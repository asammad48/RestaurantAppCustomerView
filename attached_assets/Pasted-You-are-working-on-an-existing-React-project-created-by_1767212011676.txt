You are working on an existing React project created by Replit.

TASK: Clean up the project by removing all 3D objects, libraries, and logic while keeping the app functional and preserving the project structure.

==================================================
1) REMOVE 3D LIBRARIES AND IMPORTS
==================================================
- Remove all imports related to 3D, such as:
  - Three.js (`three`)
  - @react-three/fiber
  - @react-three/drei
  - Any other 3D rendering library
- Remove any CSS or assets specifically used for 3D objects if they are no longer needed

==================================================
2) REMOVE 3D OBJECTS AND COMPONENTS
==================================================
- Delete or comment out all components that render 3D models, including:
  - `<Canvas>` elements
  - `<mesh>` or `<primitive>` components
  - Lights, cameras, helpers, and orbit controls
- Remove any suspense or fallback logic used for 3D loading
- Remove any JSX directly rendering 3D models

==================================================
3) REMOVE 3D STATE AND HANDLERS
==================================================
- Remove state variables used specifically for 3D interaction, e.g., rotation, zoom, selected 3D object
- Remove event handlers used for 3D gestures (pointerDown, pointerMove, pinchZoom)
- Remove animation loops or effects tied to 3D (e.g., `useFrame` from @react-three/fiber)
- Ensure there are no references to deleted 3D objects in other components

==================================================
4) REMOVE 3D UTILITY FUNCTIONS
==================================================
- Remove helper functions that calculate 3D transforms, rotations, scaling, or camera positions
- Remove any 3D-specific math or vector operations

==================================================
5) CLEANUP AND TEST
==================================================
- Check for broken imports or warnings after removing 3D code
- Remove any unused variables, components, or assets
- Verify that the app runs without errors
- Ensure the app structure and routing remain unchanged

==================================================
EXPECTED RESULT
==================================================
- No Three.js, @react-three/fiber, @react-three/drei, or 3D code remains
- No broken imports, warnings, or errors
- The app is functional with all non-3D UI intact
- Project structure and other features (like buttons or cards) are preserved for the next steps
