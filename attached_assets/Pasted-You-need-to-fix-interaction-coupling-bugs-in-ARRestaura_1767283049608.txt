You need to **fix interaction coupling bugs** in `ARRestaurantMenuPage.tsx`.
Currently, **multiple 3D objects are still indirectly dependent on shared controls and camera state**, causing the following issues:

---

## 🚨 CURRENT ISSUES (DO NOT IGNORE)

1. **When rotating or interacting with one object, other objects also respond**
2. **Objects feel like they move in screen space instead of world space**
3. **Scaling sometimes does nothing or feels inconsistent**
4. **OrbitControls are still globally affecting the scene instead of being conditionally locked**
5. **Camera + object interaction is not properly isolated**
6. **Mobile gestures are not clearly separated from desktop behavior**

---

## 🎯 ROOT CAUSE (IMPORTANT)

* `OrbitControls` is **global** and is still active even when an object is selected
* Object interaction is mixed with camera interaction
* Scaling is handled at Canvas level (wheel) instead of object-level intent
* No strict “interaction ownership” exists (camera vs object)

This causes **cross-object dependency**, which is unacceptable in AR-style UX.

---

## ✅ REQUIRED FIXES (MANDATORY)

### 1️⃣ HARD LOCK CAMERA WHEN OBJECT IS SELECTED

You **must modify OrbitControls** so that:

```ts
enableRotate={activeObjectId === null}
enableZoom={activeObjectId === null}
enablePan={false}
```

✔ Camera MUST NOT rotate, zoom, or move when an object is selected
✔ Only the selected object should react

---

### 2️⃣ OBJECTS MUST NEVER AUTO-ROTATE OR SHARE ROTATION

* REMOVE any `useFrame` rotation logic tied to `isSelected`
* No object should rotate unless explicitly implemented later
* Objects must remain **fully independent**

✔ Each object owns only:

* its position
* its scale
* its selection state

---

### 3️⃣ SCALING MUST BE OBJECT-OWNED (NOT CAMERA-OWNED)

Scaling must:

* Apply **only to `activeObjectId`**
* Never affect siblings
* Be clamped between safe limits

Correct logic already exists — **ensure nothing else modifies scale**

---

### 4️⃣ WORLD SPACE MUST BE FIXED

Each object:

* Must have a **fixed world position**
* Must NOT change position when camera rotates
* Must NOT re-center on interaction

This line is correct and must remain untouched:

```ts
const position = [(index - (total - 1) / 2) * 2.5, 0, 0];
```

---

### 5️⃣ MOBILE VS DESKTOP INTERACTION RULES

#### 📱 MOBILE

* Tap = select object
* Pinch = scale selected object
* No camera movement when object selected

#### 🖥 DESKTOP

* Click = select object
* Scroll + Ctrl = scale selected object
* Drag rotates camera ONLY if no object selected

---

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY (MANDATORY – FOLLOW STEP BY STEP)

### 🔹 TEST 1: MULTI-OBJECT ISOLATION

1. Add **2–3 objects**
2. Select object A
3. Interact
4. Confirm:

   * Object B does NOT move
   * Object C does NOT rotate
   * Camera does NOT rotate

❌ FAIL if any object reacts unintentionally

---

### 🔹 TEST 2: CAMERA LOCK

1. Select an object
2. Drag screen / mouse
3. Camera must stay locked

❌ FAIL if camera rotates

---

### 🔹 TEST 3: SCALE OWNERSHIP

1. Select object A
2. Scale up
3. Confirm:

   * Only A scales
   * B and C remain unchanged

❌ FAIL if others scale

---

### 🔹 TEST 4: DESELECT RESET

1. Deselect object
2. Drag screen
3. Camera rotation should resume

❌ FAIL if camera stays locked

---

### 🔹 TEST 5: MOBILE EMULATION

Use Chrome DevTools → Mobile Mode

* Tap selects
* Pinch scales
* No ghost movement

---

## ⛔ IMPORTANT RULE

**DO NOT SUBMIT / COMMIT / MARK COMPLETE**
❌ if **ANY** of the above tests fail
❌ if **ANY** object still affects another
❌ if camera moves while object is selected

This is an **AR-style interaction**, not a normal 3D viewer.

---

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

✔ Objects are fully independent
✔ Camera respects selection state
✔ Scaling works every time
✔ Desktop & mobile behavior is predictable
✔ No shared rotations, no drifting, no coupling
