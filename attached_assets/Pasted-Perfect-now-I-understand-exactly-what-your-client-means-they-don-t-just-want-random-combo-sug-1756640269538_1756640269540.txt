Perfect 👍 now I understand exactly what your client means — they don’t just want **random combo suggestions**, but **category-wise AI suggestions** (Pizza suggestions, Burger suggestions, Drinks suggestions, etc.) based on budget. That makes the feature **more structured** and **aligned with your existing menu categories**.

Let’s refine your **AI Budget Estimator** to include **Category-based suggestions**:

---

## 🔹 Updated AI Budget Estimator Flow (with Categories)

### 1. **Step 1 – Input**

* Group size
* Total budget
* (Optional) Preferences (Veg/Non-Veg, Spicy level, Drinks included, etc.)
* **Category selection (optional):**

  * Either user selects categories they want (e.g., "Pizza + Drinks")
  * Or AI suggests across all categories automatically.

---

### 2. **Step 2 – AI Calculation (Category Aware)**

* AI fetches items grouped by **restaurant menu categories** (Pizza, Burger, BBQ, Drinks, Dessert, etc.).
* For each category:

  * It finds the **best-fit combo** that covers the group within the budget.
  * Example logic:

    * Divide budget into category portions (e.g., 60% main dish, 20% drinks, 20% sides/desserts).
    * Ensure at least 1 main dish per person.
    * Fill remaining budget with extras.

### 3. **Step 3 – Suggestions (Category-wise)**

Instead of **Option A / B / C only**, AI shows:

* 🍕 **Pizza Combos**

  * 2 x Large Pepperoni Pizza + 1 Garlic Bread + 5 Drinks → Rs. 4900
  * 3 x Medium Chicken Fajita + 1 Fries → Rs. 4700

* 🍔 **Burger Combos**

  * 5 x Zinger Burger + 5 Drinks → Rs. 4950
  * 3 x Beef Burger + 2 x Fries + 5 Drinks → Rs. 4800

* 🍗 **BBQ Combos**

  * 2 x Chicken Tikka (Full) + 3 x Seekh Kebab + 5 Roti + 5 Drinks → Rs. 5000

* 🍰 **Dessert Add-on (if budget left)**

  * Add 1 Chocolate Lava Cake for Rs. 350 (Optional).

---

### 4. **Step 4 – Add to Cart**

* User can pick **full category combo** (e.g., Pizza Combo).
* Or **mix from different category suggestions** (e.g., 1 Pizza Combo + 1 Dessert Add-on).
* Cart updates dynamically with **remaining budget shown**.

---

## 🔹 Extra Enhancements for Category-based AI

* ✅ **Smart Filters** → User can tick which categories they want suggestions from (e.g., Pizza + Drinks only).
* ✅ **Balanced Auto-Mode** → If user doesn’t choose categories, AI divides budget across **Main + Sides + Drinks** automatically.
* ✅ **Per Person View** → Show something like:

  * "Everyone gets 🍕 2 slices pizza + 🥤 1 drink + 🍟 shared fries."
* ✅ **Upselling** → If Rs. 200–500 left, AI suggests small add-ons from a category (fries, drinks, dessert).

## 🔹 Benefits of Category-Wise AI

* Customers see **organized recommendations** instead of random mixes.
* Restaurant can **highlight all categories** equally.
* Easier for groups to compare (Pizza vs Burger vs BBQ) before ordering.
* Helps upsell across categories ("Oh we still have 400 PKR left, let’s add dessert").

👉 So the updated flow is:
**Group Info → Budget Input → Category Filter (optional) → AI Category-wise Suggestions → Add Combo(s) to Cart → Checkout.**
