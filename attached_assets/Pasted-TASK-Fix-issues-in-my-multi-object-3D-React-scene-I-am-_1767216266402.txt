TASK: Fix issues in my multi-object 3D React scene. I am using React + react-three-fiber.

CURRENT ISSUES:
1. Rotating one object also rotates the second object.
2. Objects are moving unexpectedly across the screen.
3. Objects do not expand/scale properly when interacting.
4. Mobile and desktop gestures are inconsistent.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each 3D object must have its **own independent rotation and scale state**.
2. Only the **selected object** should rotate or scale.
3. Objects must stay **fixed in world space**; no unintended movement.
4. Pinch gesture (mobile) or mouse wheel (desktop) should **expand/scale only the selected object**.
5. Camera should optionally orbit the **selected object**, without affecting others.
6. UI elements (Plus button, Close button, Price/Discount tags) must remain functional and touch-friendly.
7. Mobile:
   - Single-finger drag → rotate selected object or orbit camera around selected object.
   - Pinch → scale selected object.
   - Tap → select object to open detail card.
8. Desktop:
   - Mouse drag → rotate camera or object (depending on implementation).
   - Ctrl + mouse wheel → scale selected object.
   - Click → select object to open detail card.

SUGGESTED APPROACHES:
- Assign **independent refs** and `useFrame` rotation for each object.
- Apply **scale state** per object, updated by gestures.
- Optionally use camera orbit around the selected object rather than rotating the whole scene.
- Fix object positions in world space; avoid applying global transforms.
- Ensure smooth damping for rotation and zoom.
- Keep UI overlayed properly and crisp on all screens.

REQUEST:
- Provide example React code demonstrating **three 3D objects**:
  - Independent rotation and scaling
  - Camera focusing/orbiting selected object
  - Mobile-friendly gestures and desktop interactions
  - Integrated Plus/Close buttons and Price/Discount tags
- Include suggestions on how to structure state and controls to prevent unintended rotation or movement.
